        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Queens Match is an application developed to serve the community by
          connecting mentors with mentees. The need for such a solution arose
          from genuine community requirements that were not met by existing
          platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim is to establish a robust infrastructure and develop key
          features that are tailored to meet these needs. As the project
          evolves, contributions will be welcomed similar to any open-source
          project, necessitating that we develop it in a maintainable and easily
          expandable manner.
        </p>
        <h2>Skills and Competencies</h2>
        <p>
          This project operates in a team development format, providing team
