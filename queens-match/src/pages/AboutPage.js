                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Queens Match is an application developed to serve the community by connecting mentors with mentees.
                    The need for such a solution arose from genuine community requirements that were not met by existing platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The aim is to establish a robust infrastructure and develop key features that are tailored to meet these needs.
                    As the project evolves, contributions will be welcomed similar to any open-source project,
                    necessitating that we develop it in a maintainable and easily expandable manner.
                    Proper documentation is also required, which is an essential skill in the professional world.
                </p>

                <p>

                    While the design is presented as a mobile application, it should be styled and adapted for a web environment.
